{"text":"What Makes A Good Test Manager?\n\nThey come in all shapes and sizes, industries, and experience levels.\n\nBut no matter who they are, a strong Quality Assurance (QA) Manager is pivotal in ensuring the delivery of high-quality software products.\n\nSo what exactly makes for a good test manager?\n\n\nWhile this can vary from project to project and company to company, we’ve compiled a list of the most common personality traits and qualities (😉) we’ve seen from surveys, articles, and forums that seem to set a good test manager apart from the rest.\n\nHere’s our list of the top 7 qualities. Let us know what you think of our list and if you think we’re missing one.\n\n\n7 Qualities That Make a Good Test Manager\n\nTest managers need to call on a lot of different qualities and strengths throughout their day, some more than others. \n\nHere’s our list of those traits they need to call on the most:\n\n\n1. Effective Communication\n\nSoftware developers, testers, end users, and executive stakeholders don’t always speak the same language. And they also don’t have the same drivers, pressures, and perspectives.\n\nThat’s why we believe a hallmark of a good QA Manager is their ability to communicate effectively across all of these groups. From being able to effectively report project status and conduct risk analysis to bridging the gap between technical and non-technical individuals, QA managers need to weave in and out of each of these conversations multiple times a day. \n\nPerhaps most importantly, they need the ability to diplomatically say \"no\" when development standards are not met or hold a hard line when it comes to meeting a schedule.\n\n\n2. Attention to Detail\n\nDevelopers and end users each have their own nuances and requirements. Test managers need to understand them both.\n\nThat’s why having a detail-oriented QA Manager that is able to pay close attention to every aspect of the software development process to ensure that delivery is on schedule without missing a defect or due-date is critical.\n\nEvery day, these test managers hold the line to drive a quality-focused culture and a sound design, understanding that every detail matters in meeting customer expectations.\n\n\n3. Big Picture Thinking\n\nBeyond the minutiae of day-to-day testing or test script design, a good QA manager also knows how to think big. \n\nThey know how to balance the need for quality with the demands of business drivers that are shaping the larger environment around a project, making decisions that align with the overall business strategy and communicating these elements with stakeholders. \n\nThis ability to see the bigger picture ensures that daily quality efforts are aligned with the larger company objectives driving the project forward.\n\n\n4. A Process-Oriented Mindset\n\nA process-oriented approach is another unsung quality for QA managers because of the need to maintain timelines, including by streamline processes and improving testing efficiency. \n\nFrom test cycle to test cycle or project to project, the ability to identify and implement process improvements while maintaining a high standard of quality helps to keep projects on track and working more efficiently.\n\n\n5. Creativity\n\nWith the strictness of test cases and the precision of reporting, creativity probably doesn’t sit top of mind when it comes to describing QA managers.\n\nHowever, creativity is another essential quality for test managers, leveraged throughout each part of their day. From devising innovative input scenarios and uncovering edge cases that could potentially undermine a system to creating new ways to share updates with stakeholders, creative thinking is crucial throughout the development process.\n\n\n6. Intellectual Curiosity\n\nIntellectual curiosity drives QA Managers to stay ahead of the curve. \n\nThis trait helps test managers proactively identify issues, risks, or required changes to a development project or stakeholder. This quality also applies in a more technical sense working with their technical and testing expertise to develop regression or experimental tests to ensure that the software remains robust and reliable, all while catching defects as early in the process as possible.\n\n\n7. Mental Rigor\n\nLast, but certainly not least, mental rigor is table stakes for a strong test manager. \n\nFrom the ability to create comprehensive test cases based on defined business and technical requirements to defining precision test schedules, test cases, and reports, test managers are quarterbacking the entire testing process. Add in additional stress from multiple testing cycles and tight deadlines and it is easy to see why mental rigor is foundational.\n\n\nTake Your Testing from Good to Great\n\nWhen a project has a strong test manager, teams just assume that every aspect of the software development process will always be meticulously planned, executed, and monitored for quality. \n\nBut, the truth is that many test managers cannot do it alone; they have a secret weapon: a test management platform.\n\nWith a resource like TestMonitor, test managers can streamline testing workflows, collaborate with testers and stakeholders, automate repetitive tasks, and ensure their teams have what they need to evaluate quality.\n\nWant to see how TestMonitor can take your QA to the next level? Contact us now and we will set your organization up with its own 14-day free trial. \n\nIn the meantime, we also welcome you to watch our recent webinars to learn even more about the power of TestMonitor.","metadata":{"title":"What Makes A Good Test Manager?","author":"Thijs Kok","description":"We’ve compiled a list of the most common personality traits and qualities the TestMonitor team believes set a good test manager apart from the rest.","og:description":"We’ve compiled a list of the most common personality traits and qualities the TestMonitor team believes set a good test manager apart from the rest.","og:title":"What Makes A Good Test Manager?","twitter:description":"We’ve compiled a list of the most common personality traits and qualities the TestMonitor team believes set a good test manager apart from the rest.","twitter:title":"What Makes A Good Test Manager?","og:image":"https://www.testmonitor.com/hubfs/qa%20manager%20with%20programmer.png","og:image:width":"2400","og:image:height":"1256","og:image:alt":"Test Manager Instructing Developer","og:url":"https://www.testmonitor.com/blog/what-makes-a-good-test-manager","og:type":"article"},"credits":2}

{"text":"QA Manager: what is it?\n\nWhat is a QA (Quality Assurance) Manager or Test Manager?\n\nQuality Assurance Manager (QA Manager) is a very mysterious word for a very useful job within the group Blue Soft. Let's go back to the head of our test team, Arnaud Walet, to find out more about his job, its constraints and its advantages.\n\n\nQA Manager or test manager: job description\n\nTo begin with, the main objective of this role. It is to put in place all the tools and processes to test the applications or sprints that are developed. The QA manager intervenes within a development team. He tests the achievements of his colleagues and improves the finished product. To do this, he/she will have to test the entire scope to ensure that the deliverable or what is going to be delivered works correctly.\n\nNot to be confused with the people in charge of testing, who write the test scenarios and execute them. The QA Manager supervises, trains and accompanies the testers while setting up the tools on which the test teams will work.\n\nArnaud sums up: \"The main functionality is to guarantee the quality of an application, i.e. its proper functioning.\n\n\nA position as agile as development\n\nThe QA manager, like his colleagues, lives with the development of features. These can be very evolving. Arnaud explains: \"Applications are constantly being developed and evolving, whether through new features or updates to the framework. We have to do regression testing to make sure that the application still works as it did before. This agility is both a complexity and one of the major advantages of this job, as Arnaud explains: \"What I like about the QA job is the possibility of working in a lot of different technological fields and it's true that we have quite a few possibilities. We are lucky enough to have the entire data chain, from the database to the display, including processing.\n\n\nQA Manager, the agent that gets under the user's skin\n\nTesting, testing and re-testing means imagining the user's usage paths over and over again and constantly putting yourself in his shoes. \"You have to put yourself in the user's shoes and think of all the crazy things that could happen in production. Maybe once in a hundred, once in a thousand, but at least cover it on our side and make sure that the application responds as specified.\n\n\nA business that guarantees user satisfaction\n\nArnaud describes his work in relation to app quality and customer satisfaction.\"It's a job that is not well known but that tends to develop for the simple reason that in the digital age, when we download an app, go to a restaurant or whatever: we often look at the reviews. The first reflex we would have to order something is to look at the reviews. Well, for an application, generally, when we download it or when we use it, we look at the reviews to know if it is stable and if it does not crash. And in fact, the reviews reflect the quality of the application. Definitely a rewarding and vital role in our digital design business.\n\nWant to join us as a tester or QA manager?
