{"text":"What is a Technology Leader?\n\nRiaan Gouws\n\n\nRiaan Gouws\n\nInnovation leadership & leading high performing engineering teams to deliver value\n\nPublished Oct 3, 2022\n\nSomeone asked me today how I would describe my role as a technology leader.\n\nFor me, it was a odd question, since I would categorize myself as an technology facilitator, innovator and strategist. Leader would be my last choice, since the word to me implies some sort of authoritative influencing, where I believe you should be able to share your views, strategy and vision in a collaborative environment.\n\nIt’s also my job to inspire and motivate people. I have to make sure that they are working together effectively, are excited about what they’re doing, and understand how their work matters in the big picture.\n\nIt is also my job to enable my organization to meet its goals through technology. This is achieved by focusing on three key aspects: innovation, being strategic, and being responsive. These three things allow you to influence the direction of your organization without having formal authority. By innovating, you can show your team the huge potential that technology has within the organization and how it can help the company achieve its goals. By being strategic and staying on top of industry trends, you can demonstrate how the company can move forward with technological improvements to stay competitive. By being responsive to both users and colleagues, you will create a culture that lets others know that they can count on you for timely help and advice when it's needed most.\n\nWhat does it mean to you?\n\nHelp improve contributions\n\nMark contributions as unhelpful if you find them irrelevant or not valuable to the article. This feedback is private to you and won’t be shared publicly.\n\nContribution hidden for you\n\nThis feedback is never shared publicly, we’ll use it to show better contributions to everyone.","metadata":{"title":"What is a Technology Leader?","description":"Someone asked me today how I would describe my role as a technology leader.

{"text":"Seven Tips On Being A Technology Leader\n\nThis month marks my five-year anniversary of joining Oliver Wyman Digital, the business I now head up in the UK and Ireland. When I think about career progression, mine has been like a level in the Chuckie Egg video game – there are long ladders, but also places to hop off and sidestep onto another route. In my case, this was moving from working exclusively with financial services companies for six years into helping businesses across all industries deliver technology transformations.\n\nI started late in technology, but that has not hampered my move into such an exciting and growing sector. I’m now keen to show others – women, non-binary, BAME, LGBTQ+, or any combination of minorities – how they can develop into technology leadership positions.\n\nHere are my top tips for success:\n\nTIP #1: DON’T THINK YOU HAVE TO HAVE A BACKGROUND IN TECHNOLOGY\n\nWhether you’re in tech or any other sector, being a leader doesn’t mean you need to be the smartest person in the room or the best coder on the team. Sincerity, trust, communication, decisiveness, and an ability to empower others are far more important. With more tech jobs out there than there are qualified candidates, take your existing skills and an inquisitive mind and apply them to a role you’re interested in, preparing to learn the rest along the way.\n\nWhen you come to manage others, stay focused on leadership and empathy, not developing your tech skills to an expert level.\n\nThink of your team as a car with many moving parts and yourself as the driver behind the wheel. In this analogy, you don’t have to be a mechanic to set the direction and speed. It’s useful if you can learn how to change a tire, but you must trust the experts on your team to corner balance the suspension or change the transmission fluid.\n\nTIP #2: USE A BROAD RANGE OF RECRUITMENT CRITERIA\n\nI frequently hear about a skills gap and a lack of diversity in the tech sector. Tech Nation, the UK network for tech entrepreneurs, reports that overall only 17 percent are women and 15 percent from an ethnic minority – both far below what is representative of the wider UK population.\n\nTo address this, consider using a broad range of recruitment criteria. For example, don’t put too much emphasis on an Oxbridge education or the number of years’ experience required from candidates. Also, learn from how other companies are doing things: the Tech Talent Charter collates best practice for recruitment from its signatories.\n\nHaving a flexible recruitment policy for tech roles has the added benefit of reducing the barriers preventing existing employees from moving into tech roles. At Oliver Wyman, we’re planning to use the UK government’s Apprenticeship Levy funding to offer training in data analytics to our existing employees already in the business.\n\nTIP #3: CHALLENGE YOURSELF TO MAKE UNCOMFORTABLE HIRING DECISIONS\n\nA candidate who agrees with everything you say may not be as helpful in the long run as one who challenges the status quo and changes it for the better. Disruptive, tenacious, and talented people can bring unexpected new ways to solve a problem.\n\nTIP #4: KEEP HOLD OF THE GREAT PEOPLE YOU HIRE\n\nWith my teams, I want to do as much as possible to keep them. Oliver Wyman research shows that while women begin their careers with ambitions equal to those of men, between the ages of 30–50 they become less willing than men to make sacrifices in their personal lives, and between 40 and 50 the proportion of women with ambitions to reach senior management drops below that for men. To keep women in our teams, I make it my business to find out if our policies on issues such as parental leave and flexible working meet the industry standards and there is no stigma attached to taking advantage of them. Again, the Tech Talent Charter provides a best practice guide to retention.\n\nTIP #5: MAKE MENTORING A KEY ELEMENT OF YOUR ROLE\n\nConsider helping to set up mentoring relationships, making yourself available as a mentor, and showcasing role models those in the minority can identify with. Don’t underestimate the power you have as a leader to act as a sponsor. Use your connections to advance the careers of those on your team by endorsing and guiding them.\n\nTIP #6: CREATE A WORKPLACE WHERE TALENTED TECHIES WANT TO WORK\n\nThe number of technologists in our UK and Ireland Digital team has grown from 15 in 2014 to more than 100 today. This expansion has only been successful because we made a change to internal culture to create the kind of workplace where technologists with cutting-edge skills want to work. For example, we have done away with the assumption that work is best done in the office: Working from home is part of a normal week for our data engineers. We curate our office social calendar around multiple interests, and prioritize family events held to mark Pride and Christmas.\n\nThis culture shift has included some physical transformations in the office. For example, our head office in London was redesigned to create more collaborative working spaces and quiet working pods. Our in-house IT team now provides high-spec Macs for our digital and design teams, and our London Bridge office even has an office dog (his name’s Angus). While we still lack the slides and beach volleyball court of the hallowed Googleplex, our sites enable both co-creation and hard coding.\n\nTIP #7: PREPARE TO BE AMAZED\n\nMy final piece of advice is be prepared to be amazed when the team you’re leading delivers something way beyond your expectations. And, of course, let them know how much you appreciate all their hard work!\n\nDeborah O’Neill is a London-based partner and head of Oliver Wyman’s Digital practice in the United Kingdom and Ireland.","metadata":{"title":"Seven Tips On Being A Technology Leader","description":"Bridge the skills gap to create diverse, high performing teams","author":"Deborah O&#39;Neill","fb:app_id":"373202479535707","og:url":"https://www.oliverwyman.com/our-expertise/insights/2020/mar/needed-more-women-with-power/collection-of-articles/seven-tips-on-being-a-technology-leader.html","og:title":"Seven Tips On Being A Technology Leader","og:description":"Bridge the skills gap to create diverse, high performing teams","og:image":"https://www.oliverwyman.com/content/dam/oliver-wyman/v2/publications/2020/March/seven-tips-on-being-a-technology-leader-1600x602.png.imgix.bigTile.png","twitter:title":"Seven Tips On Being A Technology Leader","twitter:description":"Bridge the skills gap to create diverse, high performing teams"},"credits":2}
