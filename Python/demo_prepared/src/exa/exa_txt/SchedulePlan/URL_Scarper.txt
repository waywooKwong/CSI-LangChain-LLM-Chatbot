By conducting regular internal audits, organizations can ensure they meet the requirements outlined in the quality management system.\nOne of the key benefits of having an internal audit schedule is identifying areas for improvement within the organization. By reviewing processes, procedures, and practices, internal audits help identify any gaps or deficiencies. This allows for implementing corrective actions, improving overall operational efficiency and reducing the risk of non-compliance with ISO 9001.\n\nAdditionally, an internal audit schedule provides a structured approach to ensure that all areas of the organization are audited promptly. This helps prevent missed opportunities for improvement and maintains a consistent focus on quality throughout the organization.\n\n\nThe Key Component of the Internal Audit Schedule in ISO 9001\n\nThe Internal Audit Schedule is a crucial ISO 9001 Quality Management System component. It defines the frequency and scope of internal audits to evaluate the effectiveness of the organization's processes and compliance with ISO 9001 requirements.\n\n1. Departments: The Internal Audit Schedule should encompass all departments within the organization, including HR, health safety environment, administration, supply chain, warehouse, quality assurance, control, etc. Each department plays a vital role in the organisation's overall functioning, and it is crucial to assess their adherence to ISO 9001 requirements.\n\n2. Planned audit: The Internal Audit Schedule should clearly outline the planned audit dates for each department. These audits should be scheduled at regular intervals and should take into consideration any specific requirements or risks associated with each department. By planning the audits, organizations can ensure a systematic and comprehensive evaluation of their processes.\n\n3. Audit carried out, and non-conformities reported: The Internal Audit Schedule should include a section to record the audit findings once the audit is conducted. This involves identifying any non-conformities or deviations from the ISO 9001 requirements. Non-conformities can range from minor deviations to significant issues that require immediate attention. It is essential to document these findings accurately to facilitate corrective actions.\n\n4. Audit carried out and non-conformities reported: The Internal Audit Schedule should allow multiple annual audits. This recurring process continuously evaluates the organization's adherence to ISO 9001 requirements. By repeating the audits periodically, organizations can monitor their progress and identify any recurring issues or trends that must be addressed.\n\n5. CAR/PAR closed through follow-ups: Corrective and preventive actions (CAR/PAR) are integral to the audit process. Once non-conformities are identified, organizations must take appropriate actions to rectify them and prevent their recurrence. The Internal Audit Schedule should include provisions for closing CAR/PAR through follow-ups. This involves verifying the effectiveness of the implemented actions and ensuring that non-conformities are resolved satisfactorily.\n\nThe key components of the Internal Audit Schedule in ISO 9001 revolve around planning, execution, and follow-up. Organizations can maintain a robust internal audit process by including all relevant departments, conducting regular audits, documenting non-conformities, and closing them out through effective CAR/PAR. This process helps ensure compliance with ISO 9001 requirements, identify areas for improvement, and enhance overall organizational performance.\n\n\nEstablishing an Effective Internal Audit Schedule\n\nEstablishing an effective internal audit schedule is crucial for maintaining compliance with ISO 9001 standards. This section will provide tips and best practices to help you create a robust internal audit schedule for your organization.\n\n1. Determine the frequency: Consider the size and complexity of your organization to determine how often internal audits should take place. ISO 9001 recommends conducting internal audits at planned intervals, ensuring all areas of the organization are audited within a defined timeframe.\n\n2. Assign resources: Identify competent auditors who have a solid understanding of ISO 9001 requirements. Ensure that they have the necessary skills to conduct audits objectively and effectively.\n\n3. Prioritize high-risk areas: Focus on key processes and areas that pose a higher risk to quality. By prioritizing these areas, you can allocate resources and proactively address potential issues.\n\n4. Create an audit checklist: Develop a comprehensive checklist based on ISO 9001 requirements. This will guide auditors during the audit process, ensuring that all relevant areas are covered.\n\n5. Maintain records: Keep detailed records of internal audit activities, findings, and corrective actions. This documentation is essential for demonstrating compliance during external audits.\n\nBy following these best practices, you can establish an internal audit schedule that meets ISO 9001 requirements and contributes to continuous improvement and maintaining a robust quality management system.\n\n\nMonitoring and Evaluating the Effectiveness of Internal Audits\n\nOnce you have established an internal audit schedule, monitoring and evaluating the audits' effectiveness is important. This will ensure that your organization is not only meeting ISO 9001 requirements but also continuously improving its quality management system.\nTo monitor the effectiveness of internal audits, consider the following:\n\n1. Review audit findings: Regularly review internal audit findings to identify trends or recurring issues. This will allow you to address root causes and implement corrective actions to prevent similar issues from arising.\n\n2. Seek feedback: Encourage auditors to provide feedback on the audit process. This can be done through post-audit evaluations or discussions. Gathering feedback will help you identify improvement areas and enhance future audits' efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n3. Conduct follow-up audits: Schedule follow-up audits to assess the implementation and effectiveness of corrective actions. This will ensure that issues identified during the initial audit have been adequately addressed and resolved.\n\n4. Measure performance: Use key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the performance of the internal audit function. This can include metrics such as the number of audits conducted, timeliness of audit reports, and effectiveness of corrective actions.\n\nBy monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of internal audits, you can identify opportunities for improvement and ensure that your organization is continuously maintaining a robust quality management system.

{"text":"Audit Plan For ISO 9001\n– ISO Templates and Documents Download\n\n\nThe audit plan is a document that outlines the scope, timing, and resources needed for an audit. It also defines the activities to be completed as part of the audit process. The audit plan can either be created from scratch or adapted from another organization’s existing strategy. It can be used to verify if all systems are up to date and in compliance with regulations. The audit plan should be written with input from all organizational stakeholders, including management, auditors, and other staff who may be involved in audits.\n\n\nTypes of Audit Programs :\n\n * Internal audit- Internal audit is a process that ensures an organization’s controls are adequate. It can also provide stakeholders assurance about the effectiveness of internal controls by evaluating whether they are operating effectively and producing accurate, timely, and relevant information. Internal audits may be performed by management, or an outside party contracted to conduct the audit.\n\n * External audit- An external audit is an assessment of the quality of a company’s accounting and financial reporting by someone not involved in the day-to-day operations. It is essential in the business world and is often used before making significant investments or entering substantial transactions.\n\n * Operational audit- An operational audit is a comprehensive review of processes and procedures. It can be used to support or identify opportunities for improvement in the organization’s efficiency, productivity, profitability, and compliance with regulations. Compliance audits can be carried out by internal staff or external auditing firms.\n\n * Information system audit- An information system audit reviews an organization’s technology infrastructure and security measures. This type of audit aims to identify any potential areas for improvement in data collection, storage, processing, and transmission. The audit process includes evaluating the current state of operations and identifying vulnerabilities and risks to recommend changes that will help improve performance.\n\n * Financial Audit – The goal of the audit is to provide assurance that all transactions are in order, not fraudulent. It also ensures that the company has complied with any laws or regulations that pertain to its business operations.\n\n * Compliance audits – Compliance audits are concerned with whether an organization has complied with the requirements on which they have been assessed. Compliance audits often occur every few years to ensure that such regulations remain up-to-date with current legislation or changing economic conditions.\n\n * Risk Assessment Audit Program – This type of audit is important because it helps organizations identify potential risks and vulnerabilities within their organization. It’s also called an organizational risk assessment or enterprise risk management (ERM).\n\n\nBenefits Of A Audit Plan\n\nAn audit plan is a systematic approach to the examination of an organization’s compliance with regulatory requirements. It has numerous benefits which some of these include:\n\n * Increased productivity through streamlined processes and procedures in an audit plan.\n\n * Decreased number of errors due to better audit procedures and potential threats are identified priory.\n\n * Management can use audit plans as a benchmark for assessing risks and vulnerabilities, or they can provide an overview of the level of risk in your organization. Auditors will be responsible for ensuring that their clients are minimizing risks by applying appropriate controls.\n\n * Audit plans help to organize the audit work and in a well-defined manner. They define the scope of the audit, what will be audited, who will do it, and how long it will take them. These plans are prepared before the start of an audit process to ensure that all aspects of the assignment are planned for and taken care off.\n\n * It helps to prevent any misunderstanding with clients or employees and establishes clear expectations of what will happen.

Internal employees will be more passionate about planning audits as they understand the business objectives. The downside to this is that the audit insights will be biased to the organization and won’t find any loopholes if they exist.\n\n\n\nCosts- A key factor to outsourcing an audit is they provide discount benefits for a long-term contract. Since employees in an organization are not permanent, the organization does not need to spend money on training and hiring new resources. Audit planning would also be required on a contract basis rather than a regular basis.\n\n\n\nQuality- With the help of outsourcing, you can conduct various types of audits using different industry experts’ services. This will lead to better decision-making to achieve higher quality audit standards.\n\nDeveloping An Audit Plan\n\n\nDescription of audit plan- Define an audit plan by breaking down an organization into different sections of audits. Ask the following questions as to what type of audits you want to conduct, the nature and timing of audits, the breakdown structure (by function, departments, or location).\n\nRisk assessment- Risk assessment is a critical component of any audit plan. It helps identify potential risks that could result in non-compliance, fraud, or other undesirable outcomes. The main goal of risk assessment is to identify the inherent risks faced by an organization and its vulnerabilities to be mitigated or eliminated before an audit takes place. Risk assessment also brings into light the initial audits that were not considered in the earlier stage.\n\nAssign resources- Determine the personnel responsible for conducting audits and the people assisting them in their tasks.

It also defines the activities to be completed as part of the audit process. The audit plan can either be created from scratch or adapted from another organization’s existing strategy. It can be used to verify if all systems are up to date and in compliance with regulations. The audit plan should be written with input from all organizational stakeholders, including management, auditors, and other staff who may be involved in audits.\n\nTypes of Audit Programs :\n\n\nInternal audit- Internal audit is a process that ensures an organization’s controls are adequate. It can also provide stakeholders assurance about the effectiveness of internal controls by evaluating whether they are operating effectively and producing accurate, timely, and relevant information. Internal audits may be performed by management, or an outside party contracted to conduct the audit.\n\n\n\nExternal audit- An external audit is an assessment of the quality of a company’s accounting and financial reporting by someone not involved in the day-to-day operations. It is essential in the business world and is often used before making significant investments or entering substantial transactions.\n\n\nOperational audit- An operational audit is a comprehensive review of processes and procedures. It can be used to support or identify opportunities for improvement in the organization’s efficiency, productivity, profitability, and compliance with regulations. Compliance audits can be carried out by internal staff or external auditing firms.\n\n\nInformation system audit- An information system audit reviews an organization’s technology infrastructure and security measures. This type of audit aims to identify any potential areas for improvement in data collection, storage, processing, and transmission. The audit process includes evaluating the current state of operations and identifying vulnerabilities and risks to recommend changes that will help improve performance.\n\n\n\nFinancial Audit – The goal of the audit is to provide assurance that all transactions are in order, not fraudulent. It also ensures that the company has complied with any laws or regulations that pertain to its business operations.\n\n\nCompliance audits – Compliance audits are concerned with whether an organization has complied with the requirements on which they have been assessed. Compliance audits often occur every few years to ensure that such regulations remain up-to-date with current legislation or changing economic conditions.\n\n\n\nRisk Assessment Audit Program – This type of audit is important because it helps organizations identify potential risks and vulnerabilities within their organization. It’s also called an organizational risk assessment or enterprise risk management (ERM).\n\n\nBenefits Of A Audit Plan\nAn audit plan is a systematic approach to the examination of an organization’s compliance with regulatory requirements. It has numerous benefits which some of these include:\n\nIncreased productivity through streamlined processes and procedures in an audit plan.\n\n\nDecreased number of errors due to better audit procedures and potential threats are identified priory.\n\n\nManagement can use audit plans as a benchmark for assessing risks and vulnerabilities, or they can provide an overview of the level of risk in your organization. Auditors will be responsible for ensuring that their clients are minimizing risks by applying appropriate controls.\n\n\nAudit plans help to organize the audit work and in a well-defined manner. They define the scope of the audit, what will be audited, who will do it, and how long it will take them. These plans are prepared before the start of an audit process to ensure that all aspects of the assignment are planned for and taken care off.\n\n\nIt helps to prevent any misunderstanding with clients or employees and establishes clear expectations of what will happen. It also reduces time spent on reading documentation and clarifies audit procedures for everyone involved in a project.\n\nDifference Between Audit Plan And Audit Program :\n\n\n\n Audit Plan \n\nAudit Program\n\n\nAn audit plan is a document that outlines an approach to the auditing process.\nAn audit program is a set of objectives for an organization’s ongoing compliance-control activities, often put into place by management or boards of directors.\n\n\nAn audit plan is designed and prepared by an auditor before conducting an audit\nThe Audit program is an execution of procedures laid out by the auditor followed by an audit plan\n\n\nAn audit plan will cover a single project or department. It outlines the scope, objectives, and approach to be taken in an audit.\nAn audit program is a set of related work plans for auditing various aspects of an organization’s operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nShould You Plan An Internal Audit Or Outsource?\nHere are some reasons that will help you decide whether to opt for an internal audit team or to outsource the process:\n\n\nDomain knowledge- A key benefit of having an internal staff conduct an audit is excellent domain knowledge of their role and the organization. Internal employees will be more passionate about planning audits as they understand the business objectives. The downside to this is that the audit insights will be biased to the organization and won’t find any loopholes if they exist.\n\n\n\nCosts- A key factor to outsourcing an audit is they provide discount benefits for a long-term contract. Since employees in an organization are not permanent, the organization does not need to spend money on training and hiring new resources. Audit planning would also be required on a contract basis rather than a regular basis.\n\n\n\nQuality- With the help of outsourcing, you can conduct various types of audits using different industry experts’ services. This will lead to better decision-making to achieve higher quality audit standards.\n\nDeveloping An Audit Plan\n\n\nDescription of audit plan- Define an audit plan by breaking down an organization into different sections of audits. Ask the following questions as to what type of audits you want to conduct, the nature and timing of audits, the breakdown structure (by function, departments, or location).\n\nRisk assessment- Risk assessment is a critical component of any audit plan. It helps identify potential risks that could result in non-compliance, fraud, or other undesirable outcomes. The main goal of risk assessment is to identify the inherent risks faced by an organization and its vulnerabilities to be mitigated or eliminated before an audit takes place. Risk assessment also brings into light the initial audits that were not considered in the earlier stage.\n\nAssign resources- Determine the personnel responsible for conducting audits and the people assisting them in their tasks. Considerations should be made as to whether outsource the audit completely or assure they have the required skillsets for executing the audits and set a quarterly, monthly, or yearly timeline for conducting the audits.\n\nReview audit plan- Set up audit or board meetings to get the management’s input while reviewing the audit plan. Any risks need to be addressed, and proper mitigation measures should be discussed.\n\nGuidance- The internal auditors (IIA) guide IPPF(International professional practices framework) that sets globally accepted internal audit standards. The auditor’s responsibility is to follow the guidelines and standards set by these authorities for an effective internal audit process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"credits":2}

{"text":"Schedule Plan: Definition + How to Create One\n\nWritten by Coursera Staff • Updated on Feb 23, 2024\n\nDiscover what a schedule plan is, its role in project management, and how to build your project’s schedule plan.\n\n\nWhat is a schedule plan?  \n\nA schedule plan, also called a schedule management plan, is an essential component of project management. Project managers create schedule plans to determine the start and end dates of a project, the milestones along the way, and a timeline for completing individual tasks.\n\nSchedule planning can benefit a project in several ways: \n\n * Keep team members abreast of deadlines and responsibilities.\n\n * Stay mindful of time-related costs. \n\n * Monitor how resources are allocated. \n\n * Develop a solid project plan that guides the entire team through initiating, executing, and concluding a project. \n\nHear more about a schedule plan in this video from the Google Project Management Professional Certificate: \n\n\nHow to create a schedule plan\n\nFollow the steps below to start building your schedule plan.   \n\n\n1. Define the project’s activities and their duration. \n\nIn project management, an activity refers to a single stage in the process of bringing a project to completion. Each activity has its own start and end date. Altogether, a project’s activities lead to the final deliverable. \n\nWork with your project team and, if possible, subject-matter experts to create a list of all the activities required to complete the project. Account for the individual tasks for each activity and the time required to complete them. Then, you’ll need to order the activities in the most logical sequence so that the process can be tracked and managed.  \n\n\n2. Determine the project’s resources. \n\nFor this step, refer to your sequence of activities to determine what resources you’ll need to carry out those activities. Resources might include people, equipment and supplies, funding, information, or facilities. Take into account when resources will become available, and adjust the sequence of activities accordingly. \n\n\n3. Select a scheduling methodology.\n\nIn project management, there are different approaches to scheduling a project. You’ll want to select the methodology that makes the most sense for your project by considering all factors that may affect the project timeline. \n\nExplore these three scheduling methodologies: \n\n * The Critical Path Method is sequential and linear. Each task must be completed before beginning the task that follows. Industries that use the Critical Path Method include construction, aerospace and defense, and product development.\n\nRead more: Gantt Charts: What They Are And How To Make Them\n\n * Agile is an iterative method by which projects are divided into shorter-term development cycles, allowing team members to assess progress at the end of each cycle and make adjustments for the cycle that follows. Industries that use Agile include marketing and advertising, banking and finance, and health care.    \n\nRead more: What Is Agile? And When to Use It\n\n * The Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) involves identifying the time it takes to complete each task or activity, so that project managers can better estimate the project’s completion date. PERT works well for research and development projects, as well as projects that don’t involve repetitive activities. \n\nRead more: PERT Charts: What They Are and How to Use Them\n\n\n4. Select a software. \n\nProject scheduling software, such as Wrike, Atlassian, TeamWork, or Monday, can help teams complete projects in a timely fashion by:\n\n * Providing a central source of reference \n\n * Displaying a visual representation of the overall workflow, task deadlines, how the project is progressing, etc. \n\n * Organizing information about the project\n\n * Automating tasks like sending notifications to individual team members and generating data reports\n\nCollaborate with your team to select the best scheduling software for your project. \n\n\n5. Establish the schedule baseline.\n\nA schedule baseline is the schedule that project stakeholders approve once all tasks, timelines, and resources have been accounted for. Having a schedule baseline provides the team with a tool for gauging whether the project stays on schedule. \n\nWhen a task or activity takes longer than is expected, project managers and teams can refer to the schedule baseline to determine how best to get a project back on track.  \n\n\n6. Establish performance measures.\n\nJust as you use the schedule baseline to measure whether a project is progressing on time, you’ll need to establish other areas of project performance that you want to measure along the way. These can include:\n\n * Whether the team is reaching the established project milestones \n\n * The quality of the work that team members are completing at each phase of the project\n\n * Team morale and the attitudes they have toward the project\n\n * Resource management \n\nDecide how and when you will measure performance, such as holding meetings with team members and stakeholders to discuss the project or collecting their feedback through a questionnaire. \n\n\n7. Create contingency plans.\n\nWith most projects, some delays and challenges can impede progress. For example, resources crucial to a particular activity may become unavailable, thus resulting in a delay or even an added cost.  \n\nYour schedule plan should document potential risks as well as contingency plans, or Plan B, for how the team will handle instances when potential risks become a reality.  \n\n\n8. Identify schedule change control procedures.\n\nIn this section of your schedule plan, you will document instances when specific schedule elements can be changed and by whom. You should also include details about the impact of specific schedule changes on the project, including the time to completion, the need for additional resources, or changes to actual tasks and activities. The procedure itself might include several steps, such as: \n\n * Completing a change request \n\n * Assessing the work involved in implementing the change\n\n * Choosing a course of action: denying, accepting, or modifying the change request \n\n\n9. Establish the format and frequency of progress reporting. \n\nIn this section, you will document how team members should submit updates on the project. Include details such as:\n\n * Who will submit progress reports\n\n * How often they should submit reports\n\n * Required information for the reports\n\n * The format for these reports (visual representations or written descriptions)\n\n * Where the reports are submitted \n\n\nBuild project management skills with Coursera \n\nTaking online courses can be a great way to explore project management and build job-ready skills in this field. In the Google Project Management Professional Certificate, you’ll learn the foundations of project management and how to carry out a project to completion. \n\nWork in engineering?

{"text":"How to Make a Project Schedule: The Ultimate Guide (with Examples)\n\nWhat Is a Project Schedule?\n\nA project schedule is a timetable that organizes tasks, resources and due dates in an ideal sequence so that a project can be completed on time. A project schedule is created during the planning phase and includes the following:\n\n * A project timeline with start dates, end dates and milestones\n * The work necessary to complete the project deliverables\n * The costs, resources and dependencies associated with each task\n * The team members that are responsible for each task\n\nProject schedules are created and tracked with project scheduling software, which has key features that allow project managers to monitor the progress of tasks, resources and costs in real time. They can also assign work, link dependent tasks, view dashboards, allocate resources and more.\n\nProjectManager, for example, has online Gantt charts for scheduling tasks and resources, but also team management features and reporting tools for a comprehensive project management platform.\n\n\nWhat’s Included in a Project Schedule?\n\nProject schedules are created during the project planning phase and are crucial to the creation of a project plan, where the schedule plan, schedule baseline, deliverables and requirements are identified. The project schedule is designed to guide the project team throughout the execution phase of the project.\n\nThen, during the execution phase, the schedule baseline is compared against the actual project progress. The following are included in the creation of a project schedule:\n\n 1.  Deliverables\n 2.  Tasks\n 3.  Task start and end dates\n 4.  Task dependencies\n 5.  Project calendar\n 6.  Work packages\n 7.  Task duration and project timeline\n 8.  Budgets\n 9.  Resource availability\n 10. Schedule risk analysis\n\n\nProject Schedule Steps\n\nWhen creating a schedule you can use a project schedule template, which offers project schedule examples and a project schedule spreadsheet for free. But a template can only take you so far. A project schedule is not just a standard timetable that works for every project.\n\nThere are different project scheduling techniques and project planning tools involved in the scheduling process. Also, every project has different resources, timetables, scope considerations and other unique variables that must be considered in the schedule management plan.\n\nUsing project management software integrates the schedule into other project management tools, such as Gantt charts, dashboards and reports to monitor progress, as well as kanban boards to manage workflows. Whichever path you choose, these are the steps to create a project schedule:\n\n 1. Create the schedule plan for your project\n 2. Define who has authority over the schedule\n 3. Identify start and end dates for project activities and tasks\n 4. Figure out task dependencies\n 5. Sequence activities and tasks chronologically to create a project calendar\n 6. Estimate needed resources and resource availability\n 7. Determine duration of activities and tasks\n 8. Build project schedule\n 9. Monitor and control the schedule throughout the project life cycle\n\n\nFree Project Schedule Template\n\nNeed help getting started with your project schedule? Try ProjectManager’s free schedule template and practice adding tasks, phases, dependencies, resources and more in a live Gantt environment.\n\n\nOn the left-hand side the various phases of the project are outlined. These can be color-coded to make it easier to distinguish one phase from another. Under each phase are the tasks associated with it, including assignees, due dates and other resources needed to execute the scheduled tasks.\n\nThe visual timeline to the right is where things get interesting. You can see the entire project in one place, dependent tasks can be linked and milestones added to indicate important dates.\n\n\nWhat Are the Project Scheduling Techniques?\n\nEstimating the duration of project tasks as accurately as possible is key to creating a realistic schedule. To do this requires the use of various project scheduling techniques.\n\nProject managers can interview their team and other stakeholders to get their perspective on how long certain tasks can take, and can refer to historic data from similar past projects.\n\nAdditionally, project managers can use project scheduling techniques to increase the accuracy of their time estimates and minimize schedule risk. The critical path method (CPM) is an equation that shows the longest possible timeline for the project. The Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) also visualizes the flow of tasks for better estimates but shows task dependencies as well.\n\nProject managers will also use schedule compression techniques such as project crashing and fast tracking which can reduce the schedule duration without impacting the project scope. Simulation, resource-leveling heuristics, creating a task list, using a project calendar and using a Gantt chart are all other tools that can help with estimation, collection and tracking of project tasks.\n\nA work breakdown structure (WBS) shows how many tasks and deliverables there are to get to your final deliverable. It’s a network diagram that has your project goal on top with “branches” underneath that show all the steps needed to get you there. This tool makes sure you don’t leave out anything when devising your schedule. A workback schedule is another technique that allows you to break down the project scope and identify all the tasks, activities, deliverables and milestones.\n\nRegardless of your preferred scheduling methods, you need a tool designed to accommodate them equally. ProjectManager’s Gantt charts allow you to create timelines, apply a work breakdown structure and automatically calculate the critical path. Need to cut down on the white noise and view specific information? Filter for exactly what you want to see, whether it be incomplete tasks, overdue tasks, tasks assigned to certain team members or anything else you like.\n\n\nProject scheduling occurs during the planning phase of the project life cycle. When beginning to put together a schedule for your project, you should ask yourself four things to start:\n\n 1. What needs to be done?\n 2. When will it be done?\n 3. Who will do it?\n 4. Where will it be done?\n\nThe answers to these four questions will greatly inform your project schedule moving forward, as you’ll use this information to plan start and end dates, link activities, set the duration, create milestones and manage resources.\n\nFollow these steps to create a project schedule of your own!\n\n\n1. Create the Project Scope\n\nThe project scope statement is created during the initial planning. It’s a document that contains the specific goals, deliverables, features, budget, etc of your project. All of the tasks needed to complete the project successfully are listed here (which requires understanding the stakeholder’s requirements.)\n\nBe thorough when putting a task list together, you don’t want to leave anything out. By using a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) you can organize these activities and lay them out in order of completion. Understanding task dependencies and their sequence are very important for schedule management.\n\n\n2. Establish the Sequence of Tasks\n\nTasks are the small jobs that lead to the final deliverable, and it’s fairly crucial to map out the sequence of those tasks before diving into them. Oftentimes a task will be dependent on another to start or finish. You don’t want to get halfway through a task before you realize you can’t complete it due to hanging objectives.\n\n\n3. Group Tasks\n\nOnce you’ve collected your tasks and have them in proper order, you should take the opportunity to divide your tasks by importance. You need to know which is critical to the project implementation schedule and must be done first and those less important that can be done if there’s time. You could use a priority matrix to facilitate this process.\n\nThen, break your tasks down with milestones that relate to the five project phases—initiation, planning, execution, monitoring and close. Organizing your tasks with milestones makes it easier to track progress, and gives your teams a sense of accomplishment that boosts morale and productivity.\n\n\n4. Link Task Dependencies\n\nSome tasks can be done simultaneously, but some tasks are dependent on others to start or finish before they can start or finish. These task dependencies must be mapped out in your schedule to keep you aware of them, or you risk bottlenecks and blocking your team.\n\n\n5. Find the Critical Path\n\nThe critical path is a method for scheduling tasks in a project to find those which are critical to the success of the project. This allows you to make smart choices about tasks that can be ignored if time and costs become constrained. This method is commonly used for schedule risk analysis. Software that can find the critical path for you can make this step a lot easier.\n\n\n6. Assign Resources\n\nResource management and project scheduling are closely related. Every task on your schedule should have the related resources and costs associated with completing it. Tasks aren’t done on their own, and without mapping the resource availability to each task you’re in danger of going wildly over budget. With resources attached to tasks, you can more accurately plan your team’s time and keep their workload balanced.\n\n\nHow to Manage Your Project Schedule During Execution\n\nOnce you’ve got all the pieces of your schedule together, the last thing you want to do is manually punch it into a static document like a Google sheets or a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. A schedule maker can automate much of the process for you.\n\nThere are project scheduling tools on the market that are great for simple scheduling duties, but when you’re leading a project, big or small, you need a tool that can adapt to the variety of scheduling issues you’re going to need to track. Watch the video below to learn how scheduling software can help you lead your project to a successful conclusion, or continue on to read our full walkthrough.\n\n\nWhat Are Project Scheduling Tools?\n\nProject scheduling tools are used to help managers organize and execute their project’s tasks and resources within a given budget. Software offerings range from rudimentary to sophisticated and provide users with a wide spectrum of features that facilitate the scheduling of their project.\n\nSoftware devoted to scheduling a project can assist in the larger role of planning and estimation of the duration of each task. Outside of scheduling, software can also include tools that manage costs, budget, resource allocation, collaboration, communication and reporting.\n\n\nBenefits of Online Scheduling Tools\n\nUsing online scheduling software means that project managers can make data-driven time management and resource management decisions. When they see that there’s a bottleneck or some block preventing team members from moving forward on their tasks, they can quickly reallocate resources and keep the project on track.\n\nManagers and teams can work better together with the right online scheduling software and manage resources and budgets to keep the project running smoothly. Those are the big benefits, but not the only ones when using online scheduling software. Here are others:\n\n * Build detailed plans for your projects\n * View all your work on task lists and project calendars\n * Get status updates to stakeholders\n * Create task lists for yourself and your teams\n * Manage start and end dates for your tasks\n * Manage workload and reallocate work\n * Monitor performance in real time\n * Edit with drag-and-drop scheduling\n\n\nProject Scheduling\n\nLearn about Project Scheduling Software and its benefits\n\n\nMust-Have Scheduling Software Features\n\nScheduling software that has the following features will give you the most power to effectively manage your project.\n\n\nGet Tasks Organized on a Timeline\n\nProjects have lots of tasks, and they need to be organized on a timeline to create a workable schedule. Gantt charts are a visual tool that can collect all your tasks, prioritize them, link those that are dependent on one another and even break the larger project into manageable phases.\n\n\nMonitor High-Level Progress\n\nOnce your project schedule is executed, you need to keep a close watch on performance to stay on track. Dashboards are a window into progress that act like an instant status report, showing percentage of tasks complete, project variance, workload and more.\n\n\nBalance Your Team’s Tasks\n\nKeeping on schedule means allocating your resources smartly. Knowing how many tasks your team is assigned is crucial. If some are overallocated and others have too few tasks, the schedule suffers—as well as morale. You want to be able to reallocate their assignments.\n\n\nGenerate Fast and Insightful Data\n\nStakeholders have a vested interest in the success of a project, and must be regularly updated on its progress. You do that by quickly creating reports on tasks, costs, project variance, etc., and sharing them at stakeholder presentations. Filtering shows the information you want to see.\n\n\nFacilitate Teams to Work More Productively\n\nTeams need the right tools to execute the schedule on time and within your budget. Getting them to work better together is important. Look for features that allow team members to comment at the task level, attach files and share data with each other.\n\n\nHave a Centralized Repository\n\nProjects have a lot of paperwork. These documents are referred to throughout the life cycle of the project, and need to be easily accessible. Having a scheduling tool with unlimited file storage means you can keep everything in one place, and get to it fast when you need it.\n\n\nCreating a Project Schedule in ProjectManager\n\nProject scheduling software organizes your tasks on a timeline, considers the resources you have to complete the project and manages all those parts to keep the project on track.\n\nProjectManager is an award-winning scheduling software that integrates plans, timelines, budgets, communication and more to give you greater control over your project schedule. Sign up for a free 30-day trial of our software, and follow along to build an ideal project schedule.\n\n\nInitiate Your Project\n\nSet up the project before you start scheduling. In this initial phase, you set up your schedule plan, budget, resource schedule and the general timeline in which you have to produce your final deliverable.\n\nAdd the budget to create a baseline to compare to what you actually spend when executing.the project.\n\n\nDefine Tasks\n\nProject scheduling is all about managing your tasks. As we covered earlier, tasks are the small jobs that lead to your final deliverable. Defining those tasks is the first step towards proper project management.\n\nImport a task list from any spreadsheet, or use our built-in templates to get started. Add durations and due dates to those tasks to set them on a timeline on the Gantt.\n\n\nBlock Calendar\n\nProjectManager allows you to manage your project calendar in real time. Take note of the dates that your team can or cannot work. These are your holidays, paid time off and other such dates that must be established before you can create your schedule.\n\nSet holidays in the software, both global and local, to know your team’s availability. This is most helpful in managing remote teams. Outlining your typical working days is the best first step if you don’t have the other information readily available.\n\n\nSet Task Dependencies\n\nAvoiding bottlenecks and getting the work done on time are the primary reasons you’re thoroughly scheduling your project. You’ll want to link dependent tasks to ensure the work flows smoothly.\n\nConnect the dependent tasks in your project by dragging one task on the Gantt onto the other. A line will appear, and from there, you can set what type of dependency these two tasks have.\n\n\nAssign Team\n\nTeams are your most valuable resource. They do the work that gets the project to the finish line. For optimal efficiency, you need to get the right team member working on the right set of tasks.\n\nAssign team members tasks from any of the multiple project views. For further direction, you can attach detailed descriptions, priority levels and costs associated with tasks to help your team track and complete them.\n\n\nMonitor Progress\n\nOnce the schedule is set and the project is in the execution phase, managers will want to stay attuned with what’s going on without getting in the way of their team. Tracking project metrics allows you to catch issues and resolve them before they become projects.\n\nGet a high-level view of the project with our real-time dashboard. We collect project data on time, cost, workload and more, and automatically calculate and display it in colorful, easy-to-read graphs and charts.\n\n\nManage Resources\n\nKnowing your resources and keeping them balanced leads to a more productive and happy project team.\n\nUse our workload page to see how many tasks your team is assigned. The color-coded chart makes it easy to see who is overallocated, and you can reallocate their workload without leaving the page.\n\n\nAdjust Plan\n\nSchedules are living documents. As internal and external forces play on a project, you need a fast and easy way to adapt. Being flexible helps you prevent slippage.\n\nDrag and drop tasks to new start or end dates on our online Gantt chart to easily edit your schedule. All changes are instantly reflected throughout the software.\n\n\nKeep Stakeholders in the Loop\n\nStakeholders are the people with a vested interest in the project. They need to know what’s happening, and keeping them informed of your project progress is one of your key responsibilities.\n\nGenerate reports on project variance, tasks and more with a single click. You can quickly filter through results when presenting the report to stakeholders to assist in responding to their questions.\n\n\nBest Practices for the Project Scheduling Process\n\nKeeping your project on track and within budget requires a good schedule. That means creating a schedule that is both reliable and that meets the requirements of your project. To make sure your schedule is the best it can be, follow these best practices.\n\n\nThoroughly Collect Project Tasks\n\nThe last thing you want is to miss a critical task after you’ve created your project schedule. Making sure every task is accounted for and lands in the right place to get the project done on time is hard enough, without trying to squeeze in tasks missed. A work breakdown structure is a great tool to make sure you capture every step on the road to your deliverable.\n\n\nBe Realistic\n\nWhen developing your project schedule, it’s important to set reasonable durations for your tasks. It should be measurable, of course; short, if possible, but with room for changes if needed. To do this, you need to take a deep look at your resources and your team’s capacity to complete the work. The more you do this on the front end of a project, the less issues you’ll have once it starts. Remember that you can use project management tools and techniques such as the critical path method (CPM) or PERT charts to help you estimate time more accurately.\n\n\nHave Float in Your Schedule\n\nFloat is the amount of time a task can extend before it negatively impacts the final deliverable. You want to have some amount of float in your schedule to give you the wiggle room you’ll need as changes occur. But you don’t want too much float! That’s usually an indication that there is something amiss with your schedule.\n\n\nConstantly Assess the Critical Path\n\nThe critical path is the way to see which of your tasks are essential to reaching the final deliverable, and which can be sidelined if time and cost become issues by charting the project’s earliest possible completion. But know that the critical path can change during the execution of your project, so you need to go back and check it regularly.\n\n\nKeep Track of Project Scope\n\nThings change is a project. That’s unavoidable. Not responding to these changes, however, is irresponsible. Monitoring your project scope, and adjusting tasks and schedules to keep your project on track, is what managing a schedule is all about. Take note of how scope changes impact your project timeline, and if the change gets in the way of meeting your final deliverable.\n\n\nProject Schedule vs Project Plan\n\nTo wrap this up, we’ll end with some disambiguation between two related concepts; though related, a project schedule and a project plan are two different things. The project plan is the larger, grand-scheme blueprint on how the project will run. The project schedule focuses on the details on how that will get done.\n\nThe project plan is an outline that explains how the project will be managed. The project plan comes first, and the project schedule often falls under its larger project umbrella. You can’t create a project schedule without first having the large strokes of the project painted out in your project plan. Once the plan is approved, then the schedule can be added, with specific dates, duration, assignments, resources, etc.\n\nThe project schedule is made up of the specific tasks and due dates for each. It’s a timeline for the project for when the tasks will be started and completed. The schedule is more an estimation based on historical data, experience, etc. The schedule is fluid, and changes throughout the project. The plan remains the same. It defines the project goal, scope, resources needed, costs, etc. Only once these have been established can work on a schedule begin.\n\nAnother difference between the project plan and schedule is that the plan doesn’t necessitate the use of project management tools. Since the project plan is mostly a series of documents, you can just use a word processing program. However, project schedules usually run on project management software tools, with features such as Gantt charts.\n\n\nProject Scheduling Key Terms\n\n * Project Scheduling: Project scheduling is a project management process that consists of creating and managing a schedule to organize the tasks, deliverables and milestones of a project on a timeline. The project schedule defines the duration, start and end dates for activities and is used by project managers for resource management, task management and team management purposes\n * Schedule Plan: A schedule plan or schedule management plan, is a component of the project plan that defines how the schedule will be developed, monitored and controlled. It also establishes the scheduling methodology and scheduling tools used to develop the project schedule. The complexity of the schedule plan varies depending on the project. The schedule plan is also referred to as the schedule management plan.\n * Schedule Baseline: A schedule baseline is the approved version of the project schedule in the schedule plan. Once the project execution phase starts, the actual start and end dates of tasks will be compared to those established in the schedule baseline to measure performance and keep the project on track. The project schedule may differ from the schedule baseline because it changes as the project progresses.\n * Schedule Performance Index: The schedule performance index is part of earned value management and its a measurement that lets you know whether you’re on or behind schedule.\n * Schedule Variance: Schedule variance (SV) measures whether a project is on track by calculating the difference between actual progress against your projections.\n * Resource Schedule: Consists in including resource availability and capacity planning considerations when developing a schedule. That means planning tasks on a timeline based on the resources and constraints associated with each.\n * Project Calendar: A project calendar establishes the working days and hours that are available for scheduled tasks. It allows project managers to make schedule management decisions based on the time available on the calendar. A project calendar is part of the schedule plan.\n * Schedule Crashing: Schedule crashing is a project scheduling technique that consists in shortening the project schedule duration by expediting the execution of critical path activities by adding more resources, such as team members or equipment. The goal is to reduce the schedule duration without affecting the project scope.\n * Priority matrix: A priority matrix is a time management tool that allows project managers to prioritize tasks by evaluating the impact and effort associated with them. It’s similar to the Eisenhower matrix in terms of structure, but the priority matrix scales and quadrants are designed for project management.\n * Workback Schedule: A workback schedule is a project scheduling technique that allows project managers to break down the life cycle of a project by analyzing its timeline in reverse order. Similar to reverse engineering, this process allows them to have a different perspective about the project’s stages, tasks, deliverables and milestones.\n\n\nGet a Free 30-Day Trial of Our Project Scheduling Software\n\nScheduling is one of the more difficult jobs in project management, but coordinating delivery dates on your estimates can be streamlined and made more efficient when you employ the tools in ProjectManager, a cloud-based software.\n\nFrom interactive Gantt charts, resource and workload management that can be easily integrated to a real-time reporting dashboard, you’ve never had a tighter hand on your project schedule.\n\nSee why tens of thousands of project teams in organizations as diverse as NASA and the Bank of America use our tool to keep on schedule.
