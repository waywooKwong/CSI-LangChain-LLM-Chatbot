{"text":"What Is a Project Manager? A Career Guide\n\nWritten by Coursera Staff • Updated on May 29, 2024\n\nLearn about skills, salary, requirements, and reasons to consider a versatile career in project management.\n\n\nWhat is a project manager?\n\nA project manager is a professional who organizes, plans, and executes projects while working within restraints like budgets and schedules. Project managers lead entire teams, define project goals, communicate with stakeholders, and see a project through to its closure. Whether running a marketing campaign, constructing a building, developing a computer system, or launching a new product, the project manager is responsible for the success or failure of the project.\n\nThe project manager role is in demand in just about every industry. Let’s take a closer look at what project managers do, why you should consider a career in project management, and how you can get started. If you're ready to start working toward this career path now, consider enrolling in Google's Project Management Professional Certificate.\n\n\nWhat does a project manager do? Tasks and responsibilities\n\nA project manager oversees projects through the project lifecycle: initiation, planning, execution, and closure. To ensure projects are completed on time and within budget, a project manager takes on a variety of tasks and responsibilities, including:\n\n * Defining the scope of the project\n\n * Staying on schedule\n\n * Planning a project’s cost and sticking to a budget\n\n * Managing project resources (including teams and workers)\n\n * Documenting the progress of the project\n\n * Communicating with stakeholders\n\n * Assessing risks\n\n * Troubleshooting\n\n * Leading quality assurance\n\nThe sheer variety of project manager responsibilities means that no two days on the job (or two projects) are quite the same. On any given day, you might be interviewing and hiring new talent, managing team meetings, reallocating resources to cover an unexpected expense, or updating stakeholders on the progress of the project.\n\nLearn more about the lifecycle of a project in this video.\n\n\nEssential skills for project management\n\nIn this position, you play a key role in a company’s success. While many technical and workplace skills go into efficient project management, honing these five skills can help you build a foundation for success in the field:\n\n * Leadership: You’ll lead a team to achieve a goal.\n\n * Communication: You’re often the first line of communication for team members, vendors, stakeholders, and customers.\n\n * Organization: The ability to prioritize and multitask will keep projects running smoothly.\n\n * Critical thinking: Analyzing and evaluating a situation critically helps prevent issues before they happen.\n\n * A sense of humor: Approaching a project with a positive attitude can ease stress and energize your team.\n\nProject management can be a challenging career, but you’ll never face those challenges alone. You’ll often work alongside team members and use software or online tools specifically designed to streamline the process. The specific project management software depends on the project or company. Still, it will often include the capability to track time and budgets, create plans and reports, manage invoices, and share calendars across multiple teams. \n\nRead more: 11 Key Project Management Skills\n\nWant to see a day in the life of a project manager? Watch this video from the Google Project Management Professional Certificate.\n\n\nProject management methodologies\n\nAs you learn more about project planning, you may encounter terms like Agile, Scrum, or Waterfall. These refer to various methodologies—a set of guiding principles or strategies—for managing a project. Common approaches and methodologies include:\n\n * Agile\n\n * Lean\n\n * Waterfall\n\n * Scrum\n\n * Kanban\n\n * XP (Extreme Programming)\n\n * Six Sigma\n\nChoosing a methodology (or a combination of methodologies) is one of the first decisions you’ll make as a project manager. Which you choose will depend on the industry and type of project. \n\nFor example, if you’re working in software development, you may choose to employ Agile techniques. Scrum, an approach to Agile management, uses daily team meetings and short (for example, 30-day) “sprints” to develop projects quickly and efficiently. The Lean method, developed by Toyota in the 1970s, seeks to maximize value and minimize waste. It’s still commonly used in the manufacturing industry.\n\nRead more: 12 Project Management Methodologies: Your Guide\n\n\nProject management careers\n\nProject managers are in demand across industries, including construction, architecture, fashion, design, computer science, robotics, and government. Project management can be a great career path for applying team building, problem-solving, and leadership skills, while helping organizations bring ideas and initiatives to life. And since it’s such a versatile career, you can leverage these transferable skills to enhance your resume, no matter where your career takes you.\n\nProject manager roles include:\n\n * IT project manager\n\n * Construction project manager\n\n * Healthcare project manager\n\n * Technical project manager\n\n * Project sponsor\n\n * Senior project manager\n\n * Project coordinator\n\n * Project administrator\n\n * Project analyst\n\n * Project director\n\n * Project management consultant\n\n * Project officer\n\n * Project executive\n\n * Scrum master\n\nRead more: How to Become a Project Manager: 5 Steps\n\n\nHow much do project managers make?\n\nYour earning potential as a project manager depends on several factors, including the industry you work in, your employer, your skills and experience, and your education and credentials. Here is salary data from different sources:\n\n * Project Management Institute (PMI) reports that the median annual project manager salary across all industries in the United States is $115,000 [1].\n\n * Glassdoor reports that project managers make $1114,350, on average [2].\n\n * The US Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that project management specialists make $98,580 [3].\n\nRead more: Project Manager Salary: Your 2024 Guide\n\n\nProject management: Job outlook\n\nAccording to the Job Growth and Talent Gap report from PMI, employers will need to fill some 2.2 million new project management-oriented roles each year through 2027 [4]. Job seekers with a combination of leadership and technical skills will find themselves in demand in the coming years.\n\nIndustries like health care, manufacturing and construction, information services and publishing, finance and insurance, and management and professional services are expected to see the biggest growth in project-oriented roles, according to the PMI report.\n\n\nProject manager qualifications\n\nProject management is diverse, and you’ll find that qualifications often vary by industry and company. When looking at what you need to build a career in project management, consider two main areas: education and certification.\n\n\nHigher education\n\nA bachelor's degree is typically the minimum requirement to become a project manager with 68 percent of professionals holding a bachelor's degree and 14 percent holding a master's degree [5]. Many project managers have a degree in business, computer science, or an industry-related field. While not always a strict requirement, a degrzxee can help you develop the leadership skills you’ll need on the job. Some companies may look for candidates with a graduate degree such as a Master of Business Administration (MBA) or a Master of Science in Management (MSM).\n\nRead more: Do I Need a Project Management Degree?\n\n\nCertifications\n\nWhether you’re just graduating from college or looking to pivot to a new career in project management, a professional certificate or certification could help enhance your resume to make you more appealing to hiring managers. \n\n * Project Management Professional (PMP): If you already have a few years of experience working on projects in a professional setting, you can advance your career with the PMP credential from the Project Management Institute (PMI). The UCI Project Management Professional Certificate fulfills the educational requirements for the PMP exam. By earning this certificate, you’ll prepare yourself to pass the exam and receive a university-issued credential for your resume. Learn more about how to get a PMP certification.\n\n * Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM): If you're just getting started in project management, the CAPM is an entry-level project management certification also administered by the PMI. Designed for those without formal project management experience, it can help open a path to several entry-level project management positions. Read more about the CAPM certification.\n\n\nCareer pathways in project management\n\nIn addition to specific careers in project management, you'll want to think about career advancement possibilities. As you hone your skills and see projects to completion, you’ll find new pathways to advancement. Here’s a look at the hierarchy of project management roles. Keep in mind these might vary from organization to organization:\n\nCareer Level                                  Tasks\nProject coordinator                           Assists with administrative tasks for specific projects\nProject manager I                             Manages small projects under supervision of the Senior PM\nProject manager II                            Manages one large project or several smaller projects\nProject manager III                           Manages multiple or high-priority projects\nSenior project manager                        Leads multiple project teams or programs\nProgram manager                               Oversees a group of related projects to deliver outcomes\n                                              that benefit the organization\nPortfolio manager                             Manages an organization’s collection of projects and\n                                              programs\nDirector of Project Management Office (PMO)   Directs strategic planning of multiple projects and reports\n                                              to executive management\n\nRead more: Project Manager Career Path: From Entry-Level to VP\n\n\nGetting started in project management\n\nChoosing a career as a project manager could open up doors in multiple industries.

{"text":"Project manager\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nA project manager is a professional in the field of project management. Project managers have the responsibility of the planning, procurement and execution of a project, in any undertaking that has a defined scope, defined start and a defined finish; regardless of industry. Project managers are first point of contact for any issues or discrepancies arising from within the heads of various departments in an organization before the problem escalates to higher authorities, as project representative.\n\nProject management is the responsibility of a project manager. This individual seldom participates directly in the activities that produce the result, but rather strives to maintain the progress, mutual interaction and tasks of various parties in such a way that reduces the risk of overall failure, maximizes benefits, and minimizes costs.\n\nA project manager is the person responsible for accomplishing the project objectives. Key project management responsibilities include\n\n * defining and communicating project objectives that are clear, useful and attainable\n * procuring the project requirements like workforce, required information, various agreements and material or technology needed to accomplish project objectives\n * managing the constraints of the project management triangle, which are cost, time, scope and quality\n\nA project manager is a client representative and has to determine and implement the exact needs of the client, based on knowledge of the organization they are representing. An expertise is required in the domain the project managers are working to efficiently handle all the aspects of the project. The ability to adapt to the various internal procedures of the client and to form close links with the nominated representatives, is essential in ensuring that the key issues of cost, time, quality and above all, client satisfaction, can be realized.\n\n\nProject management key topics\n\n\n\n * to specify the reason why a project is important\n * to specify the quality of the deliverables\n * resource estimate\n * timescale\n * investment, corporate agreement and funding\n * implementation of management plan on to the project\n * team building and motivation\n * risk assessments and change in the project\n * maintain sustaining project\n * monitoring\n * stakeholder management\n * provider management\n * closing the project.[1]\n\nProject tools The tools, knowledge and techniques for managing projects are often unique to project management. For example: work breakdown structures, critical path analysis and earned value management. Understanding and applying the tools and techniques which are generally recognized as good practices are not sufficient alone for effective project management. Effective project management requires that the project manager understands and uses the knowledge and skills from at least four areas of expertise. Examples are PMBOK, Application Area Knowledge: standards and regulations set forth by ISO for project management, General Management Skills and Project Environment Management[2] There are also many options for project management software to assist in executing projects for the project manager and his/her team. Project teams When recruiting and building an effective team, the manager must consider not only the technical skills of each person, but also the critical roles and chemistry between workers. A project team has mainly three separate components: project manager, core team and contracted team. Risk Most of the project management issues that influence a project arise from risk, which in turn arises from uncertainty. The successful project manager focuses on this as his/her main concern and attempts to reduce risk significantly, often by adhering to a policy of open communication, ensuring that project participants can voice their opinions and concerns.\n\nThe project manager is accountable for ensuring that everyone on the team knows and executes his or her role, feels empowered and supported in the role, knows the roles of the other team members and acts upon the belief that those roles will be performed.[3] The specific responsibilities of the project manager may vary depending on the industry, the company size, the company maturity, and the company culture. However, there are some responsibilities that are common to all project managers, noting:[4]\n\n * Developing the project plans\n * Managing the project stakeholders\n * Managing communication\n * Managing the project team\n * Managing the project risks\n * Managing the project schedule\n * Managing the project budget\n * Managing the project conflicts\n * Managing the project delivery\n * Contract administration\n\n\nArchitectural project manager\n\n\n\nArchitectural project manager are project managers in the field of architecture. They have many of the same skills as their counterpart in the construction industry. And will often work closely with the construction project manager in the office of the general contractor (GC), and at the same time, coordinate the work of the design team and numerous consultants who contribute to a construction project, and manage communication with the client. The issues of budget, scheduling, and quality control are the responsibility of the project manager in an architect's office.\n\n\nConstruction manager\n\n\n\nConstruction managers are primarily involved in the areas of design, bidding, contact management and construction of a project, as well as the in-between phases and post-construction.\n\nUntil recently, the American construction industry lacked any level of standardization, with individual States determining the eligibility requirements within their jurisdiction. However, several trade associations based in the United States have made strides in creating a commonly accepted set of qualifications and tests to determine a project manager's competency.\n\n * The Construction Management Association of America (CMAA) maintains the Certified Construction Manager (CCM) designation. The purpose of the CCM is to standardize the education, experience and professional understanding needed to practice construction management at the highest level.\n * The Project Management Institute has made some headway into being a standardizing body with its creation of the Project Management Professional (PMP) designation.\n * The Constructor Certification Commission of the American Institute of Constructors holds semiannual nationwide tests. Eight American Construction Management programs require that students take these exams before they may receive their Bachelor of Science in construction management degree, and 15 other universities actively encourage their students to consider the exams.\n * The Associated Colleges of Construction Education and the Associated Schools of Construction have made considerable progress in developing national standards for construction education programs.\n\nThe profession has recently grown to accommodate several dozen construction management Bachelor of Science programs. Many universities have also begun offering a master's degree in project management. These programs generally are tailored to working professionals who have project management experience or project related experience; they provide a more intense and in depth education surrounding the knowledge areas within the project management body of knowledge.\n\nThe United States Navy construction battalions, nicknamed the SeaBees, puts their command through strenuous training and certifications at every level. To become a chief petty officer in the SeaBees is equivalent to a BS in construction management with the added benefit of several years of experience to their credit. See ACE accreditation.\n\n\nEngineering project manager\n\n\n\nIn engineering, project management involves seeing a product or device through the developing and manufacturing stages, working with various professionals in different fields of engineering and manufacturing to go from concept to finished product. Optionally, this can include different versions and standards as required by different countries, requiring knowledge of laws, requirements and infrastructure.\n\n\nInsurance claim project manager\n\n\n\nIn the insurance industry project managers often oversee and manage the restoration of a client's home/office after a fire, flood, or other disaster, covering the fields from electronics through to the demolition and construction contractors.\n\nIT project management generally falls into two categories, namely software (development) project manager and infrastructure project manager.\n\nSoftware project manager\n\n\n\nA software project manager has many of the same skills as their counterparts in other industries. Beyond the skills normally associated with traditional project management in industries such as construction and manufacturing, a software project manager will typically have an extensive background in software development. Many software project managers hold a degree in computer science, information technology, management of information systems or another related field.\n\nIn traditional project management a heavyweight, predictive methodology such as the waterfall model is often employed, but software project managers must also be skilled in more lightweight, adaptive methodologies such as DSDM, Scrum and XP. These project management methodologies are based on the uncertainty of developing a new software system and advocate smaller, incremental development cycles. These incremental or iterative cycles are time boxed (constrained to a known period of time, typically from one to four weeks) and produce a working subset of the entire system deliverable at the end of each iteration. The increasing adoption of lightweight approaches is due largely to the fact that software requirements are very susceptible to change, and it is extremely difficult to illuminate all the potential requirements in a single project phase before the software development commences.\n\nThe software project manager is also expected to be familiar with the software development life cycle (SDLC). This may require in-depth knowledge of requirements solicitation, application development, logical and physical database design and networking. This knowledge is typically the result of the aforementioned education and experience. There is not a widely accepted certification for software project managers, but many will hold the Project Management Professional (PMP) designation offered by the Project Management Institute, PRINCE2 or an advanced degree in project management, such as a MSPM or other graduate degree in technology management.\n\nIT infrastructure project management\n\n\n\nAn infrastructure IT PM is concerned with the nuts and bolts of the IT department, including computers, servers, storage, networking, and such aspects of them as backup, business continuity, upgrades, replacement, and growth. Often, a secondary data center will be constructed in a remote location to help protect the business from outages caused by natural disasters or weather. Recently, cyber security has become a significant growth area within IT infrastructure management.\n\nThe infrastructure PM usually has an undergraduate degree in engineering or computer science, while a master's degree in project management is required for senior-level positions. Along with the formal education, most senior-level PMs are certified, by the Project Management Institute, as Project Management professionals. PMI also has several additional certification options, but PMP is by far the most popular.\n\nInfrastructure PMs are responsible for managing projects that have budgets from a few thousand dollars up to many millions of dollars. They must understand the business and the business goals of the sponsor and the capabilities of the technology in order to reach the desired goals of the project. The most difficult part of the infrastructure PM's job maybe this translation of business needs / wants into technical specifications. Oftentimes, business analysts are engaged to help with this requirement. The team size of a large infrastructure project may run into several hundred engineers and technicians, many of whom have strong personalities and require strong leadership if the project goals are to be met.\n\nDue to the high operations expense of maintaining a large staff of highly skilled IT engineering talent, many organizations outsource their infrastructure implementations and upgrades to third-party companies. Many of these companies have strong project management organizations with the ability to not only manage their clients projects, but to also generate high quality revenue at the same time.\n\nProject managers in the field of social science have many of the same skills as their counterparts in the IT industry. For example, project managers for the 2020 United States Census followed program and project management policies, framework, and control processes for all projects established within the program. They managed projects designed as part of the program to produce official statistics, such as projects in systems engineering, questionnaire design, sampling, data collection, and public communications.[5] Project managers of qualitative research studies must also manage scope, schedule, and cost related to research design, participant recruitment, interviewing, reporting, as well as stakeholder engagement.[6][7]\n\n * Event planning and production\n * Master of Science in Project Management\n * Project engineer\n * Project management\n * Project portfolio management\n * Project planning\n * Product management\n * Construction manager\n\n 1. ^ \"What is project management?\". www.apm.org.uk.
