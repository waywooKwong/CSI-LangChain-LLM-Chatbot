Many will hope it is not so. But the damage that has been done cannot be easily undone. A relationship built on shared values cannot be easily restored once it is clear those values are no longer shared.For years, Israel made the case that it was America’s essential ally in the Middle East because it was the only state in the region that was a democracy—not a theocracy or an autocracy like all its neighbors.  That is no longer the case.  While most of the blame for this turn of events must go to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his extreme right-wing coalition of Jewish nationalists, some falls on America’s leaders who, to varying degrees, for years refused to acknowledge Israel’s drift toward authoritarianism or, for that matter, its serial abuses of millions of the people who lived within the borders it controlled.As recently as a week ago, only nine people in the U.S. Congress dared stand up to the lie that Israel was not a racist state. This despite decades of denying fundamental human rights to Palestinians in territories over which it asserted power simply because they were Palestinian.The chorus of American leaders who regularly promised Israel’s leaders we would be with them (no matter what they did) invited Netanyahu and the thugocracy he assembled around him to do their worst. The Israeli leaders knew there was no price to pay. They knew that American aid would keep on coming. They knew American leaders would apologize for or cover up their crimes, block the U.N. from taking action against them, and maintain the myth that they were democratic when becoming less and less so. A demonstrator wearing a mask depicting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu takes part in a sit-in to block the entrance of the Knesset, Israel's parliament, in Jerusalem on July 24, 2023.Menahem Kahana / Getty It is, of course, galling and revealing that it took the most baldfaced assault on the democratic rights of Jewish Israelis ever to get awareness of the decay within the Israeli polity to the level it is today.Part of that is due to the natural and warranted support that has long existed for Israel due to its origins as a refuge for Jews escaping the horrors of the Holocaust, and seeking a homeland from which they could control their own destiny. Part of this is due to the fact that Israel was created to be a democracy, built around ideals much like those on which the U.S. was founded. Part of this is due to the fact that Israel was a valued ally during the Cold War, a potent counterforce to Soviet friends in a vital region of the world.  We must also acknowledge that part of the support for Israel was due to the political influence of its supporters among the American electorate, from Zionist Jews to evangelical Christians. Some among these supporters have been particularly effective in making any wavering of support by political leaders seem toxic. This was accomplished via multiple means, but among these were the establishment of bright red lines, such as the argument that failing to support the government of Israel’s ethno-nationalist policies was tantamount to antisemitism.Politicians in both U.S. parties therefore failed to offer sufficient criticism to Netanyahu as he bulldozed Palestinian settlements or changed Israel’s laws to shift the country in a more theocratic direction.Even when Netanyahu, frustrated that his support from Democrats was not enthusiastic enough, became overtly partisan—embracing the GOP and, in particular, the MAGA GOP—this continued. Those who criticized Israel were ostracized and condemned. Trump offered Bibi a blank check and in exchange was offered a train station and a settlement named after him. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks with former U.S. President Donald Trump.Kobi Gideon / Getty In recent months, as Netanyahu sought to change Israel’s laws to eviscerate the power and independence of its Supreme Court, while the Biden administration offered stronger and stronger words to warn the Israeli government away from such action, no major changes were made in U.S. plans to continue to provide billions of dollars of military and other forms of aid to Israel. Promises from Netanyahu that (to Israeli observers) were clearly lies were accepted.  More recently, this tolerance of outrageous behavior was seen to fray further when—in the wake of outright lies by Netanyahu about the nature of Biden’s support for him—the U.S. president took the extraordinary step of reaching out to New York Times columnist Tom Friedman to help him communicate the truth of what he had said to the Israeli prime minister, so that Bibi could no longer continue to twist Biden’s words as he had been doing.But with the passage of the first part of Netanyahu’s plan to strip away the powers of the Israeli Supreme Court, it must be clear that the lies were lies, that the intent is undeniably anti-democratic, that we no longer share the values we once celebrated with Israel, and that the relationship must be reassessed.Strikingly, some stalwart supporters of the traditional U.S.-Israel relationship, like former U.S. ambassadors to Israel Martin Indyk and Daniel Kurtzer, have said what was previously unthinkable: That the U.S. must consider stopping the provision of military aid to Israel.They are right. We must consider it. We must, as Tom Friedman has argued in The Times, must use our special history with Israel in support of democracy in that country.But we need to recognize that Israeli politics have changed, and that while hundreds of thousands of Israelis have taken to the streets to protest the actions of the Netanyahu coalition, the damage that has already been done is likely to be compounded. More aggressive actions to settle the occupied territories using force are likely to follow. More blows against Israeli democracy are likely to follow. Even if the protests gain further momentum, divisions within Israeli politics are likely to remain for a long time to come.America’s leaders must recognize that the policy of biting their tongues when Israel’s government brutalizes Palestinians‚ or when it has telegraphed its coming attacks on its own democracy—has been a failure.Stronger steps were called for earlier. Stronger steps are called for now. “It is, of course, galling and revealing that it took the most baldfaced assault on the democratic rights of Jewish Israelis ever to get awareness of the decay within the Israeli polity to the level it is today.” Aid to Israel cannot be a blank check. It must be driven by U.S. interests. And currently, the Netanyahu government (which also sat on the fence when the U.S. called for support in Ukraine) is not acting in those interests.Shockingly, one senior U.S. government official said to me recently that as the U.S. pursued normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia, it was the Israeli government rather than that of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (also known as MBS—a leader with whom they have had bad blood), that was proving the more difficult with which to deal.U.S. political leaders must finally tune out the specious argument that opposing the actions of a racist Israeli government contemptuous of international law and fundamental human rights is somehow antisemitic. No one is doing more damage to the legitimacy of the state of Israel than the current Israeli government. No one is a greater threat to the state of Israel than Netanyahu and his coalition.The only way to revive the “special relationship” is to establish that the U.S. and Israel are actually bound together by genuinely shared values. We must be clear about what that means and about the concrete costs of failing to re-establish those values as guiding principles of the Israeli government.We must also recognize that it means protecting the rights not only of Israeli Jews but of Palestinians, as well, of making democracy and the transparent rule of law available to all who live within the borders—not just of the state of Israel but of the territories over which it exerts its authority. Because giving the Israeli government license to abuse the rights of Palestinians is part of what sent the message that we would tolerate the other abuses they have subsequently committed.  We must also recognize that Netanyahu hopes (and perhaps believes) that he can restore the special relationship by waiting for Donald Trump to be reelected. He knows that a Trump administration would not only be as contemptuous of democracy as he is, but it would be seeking to implement similar policies, in part because Trump (like Netanyahu) shares the desire to use power as a way of avoiding jail time for past crimes. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrives for a hearing at the Magistrate's Court in Rishon Lezion on January 23, 2023.Abir Sultan / Getty Of course, the consequence of a restoration of ties based on the further debasement of the principles on which both governments were once founded would mean something much worse than the end of an international relationship. It would mean a devastating blow to democracy and the rule of law worldwide. It would be a catastrophe for both nations and the planet.We have come to this dangerous moment by failing to acknowledge and actively work to stop the enemies of our values, our standing, and our security. Given the stakes and the precariousness of the current situation in both countries, we must use every legal lever available at our disposal to undo the damage that has already been done and to stop further erosion at the foundations of our societies.

Signs and flowers are pictured at a makeshift memorial for victims of a 4th of July mass shooting in downtown Highland Park, Illinois on July 6, 2022.   Max Herman/AFP/Getty Images        Washington CNN          —                     The United States has surpassed 400 mass shootings in 2023, setting the stage for a record-breaking year in gun violence without any significant federal firearm legislation on the horizon.                    America reached the grim figure by Saturday — the earliest in a year 400 shootings have been recorded since at least 2013, according to the Gun Violence Archive. Like CNN, the GVA — a non-profit group formed in 2013 to track gun-related violence — defines a mass shooting as one in which at least four people are shot, excluding the shooter.                   With five months remaining in 2023, the US has already eclipsed the number of mass shootings recorded each year from 2013 through 2018. Should the current pace continue, 2023 will see more mass shootings than in 2019 through 2022. The Gun Violence Archive started tracking these numbers in 2013.                   In 2019, it took 356 days — nearly the entire year — to hit 400 mass shootings. This year and in 2021, however, the United States reached that marker in just seven months.                       The rate of mass shootings in 2023 has consistently outpaced that of past years, with an average of nearly two mass shootings a day.                   Nearly 1 in 5 US adults has had a family member killed by a gun, including homicides and suicides, according to a 2023 survey from KFF (formerly known as the Kaiser Family Foundation). About the same proportion of adults have been personally threatened with a gun, and about 1 in 6 adults has witnessed an injury from a shooting, the survey found.                      “This is the only country in the world where men who are having breaks with reality exorcise their demons through mass slaughter,” Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, who has made gun safety legislation central to his work following the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, told CNN earlier this year.                    “We’re not the only place in the world with mental illness. We’re not the only place in the world where people are paranoid. But only in America are we so casual about access to weapons of mass destruction and only in America do we fetishize violence so much that we end up with all the mass shootings,” he added.                    The US also reached 100, 200, and 300 mass shootings more quickly this year than any other year since 2013. One hundred shootings were recorded by March; 200 by May.                      Behind the scenes, Biden administration officials have been developing ways in which the federal government can respond in the short- and long-term after a mass shooting, recognizing the physical, mental, and economic ramifications.                   But following passage of last year’s bipartisan gun safety law there’s been little political momentum for more gun safety legislation, even as the rate of mass shootings has picked up.               Shootings meet stubborn divide               Research published this year suggests that the effects of mass shootings on mental health may extend beyond the survivors and their communities to a much broader population.                   In the days after a school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, in May 2022, a mental health crisis line received a spike in messages that referenced grief, guns and other firearm-related terms, according to a study funded by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The study did not track callers’ locations, but the Crisis Text Line — a non-profit organization offering free confidential crisis intervention — serves people nationwide.                   In remarks at the National Safer Communities Summit in Connecticut last month, President Joe Biden delivered an impassioned speech arguing that he believes the movement has reached a “tipping point.”                   “Whether we’re Democrats or Republicans, we all want families to be safe. We all want to drop them off at the house of worship, a mall, a movie, the school door without worrying that it’s the last time we’re ever going to see them. We all want our kids to have the freedom to learn, to read and to write instead of learning how to duck and cover in a classroom,” Biden said in remarks at the National Safer Communities Summit last month.                   White House officials have been clear- eyed about the political realities Democrats face with the current makeup of Congress, where Republicans in control of the House of Representatives have rejected Biden’s calls for an assault weapons ban.                   Even during the first two years of Biden’s term, when both chambers of Congress were controlled by Democrats, an assault weapons ban gained little traction, in part because of the 60-vote threshold needed to break a filibuster and advance bills through the Senate.               A uniquely American tragedy               tates with weaker gun laws have higher rates of gun deaths, including homicides, suicides and accidental killings, according to a study published in 2022 by Everytown for Gun Safety, a non-profit focused on gun violence prevention.                   The political debate on gun control in America, though, is untethered from that data.                   And gun violence is still rising. Per the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the firearm homicide rate was 8.3% higher in 2021 than it was in 2020. Firearm suicide rates among people 10 years old and older also increased by 8.3% from 2020 to 2021. And the percentage of homicides attributed to firearm injuries rose from 79% in 2020 to 81% — the highest percentage in more than 50 years.                   Countries that have introduced laws to reduce gun-related deaths have seen significant progress, a previous, in-depth CNN analysis found:       Australia. Less than two weeks after Australia’s worst mass shooting, the federal government implemented a new program, banning rapid-fire rifles and shotguns, and unifying gun owner licensing and registrations across the country. In the next 10 years gun deaths in Australia fell by more than 50%. A 2010 study found the government’s 1997 buyback program — part of the overall reform — led to a drop in firearm suicide rates that averaged 74% over the five years that followed.       South Africa. Gun-related deaths dropped by almost half over a 10-year-period after new gun legislation, the Firearms Control Act, went into force in July 2004. The new laws made it much more difficult to obtain a firearm.   New Zealand. Gun laws were swiftly amended after the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings. Just 24 hours after the attack, in which 51 people were killed, then-Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced that the country’s gun laws would change. New Zealand’s parliament voted almost unanimously to reform the country’s gun laws less than a month later, banning all military-style semi-automatic weapons.   Britain. [The country] tightened its gun laws and banned most private handgun ownership after a mass shooting in 1996, a move that saw gun deaths drop by almost a quarter over a decade.               But America’s relationship to guns is unique, and its gun culture is a global outlier. For now, the deadly cycle of violence seems unlikely to abate.

And we’re all not teaching our children well.Matt LewisSenior ColumnistPublished Jul. 04, 2023 4:31AM EDT opinionPhoto Illustration by The Daily Beast / GettyWhile Americans grill burgers and hot dogs, enjoy a dip in the pool, and await the annual July Fourth fireworks display, I remain happily surprised that this day of communal patriotism is still widely accepted and generally celebrated. To be blunt, it feels like the country is coming apart at the seams and lacking some shared purpose.And I’m not alone in feeling this way. About two-thirds of Americans say the country is “more divided than usual.” To make matters worse, young people are already behaving that way. A Generation Lab poll conducted for NBC News last year confirmed that young Americans are segregating themselves along partisan lines.While this division is playing out across America, it is being stoked by political and cultural influencers on the left and right who, increasingly, have given up on the American experiment and/or reject the founders’ ethos. Indeed, the one thing that the left and the right seem to have in common these days is a belief that America isn’t all that great.  Many on the left see America as a racist country whose present status is the fruit from the poisonous tree. They want to uproot our history and destroy any lingering reverence for our founders.  Many on the right now advocate a different sort of anti-Americanism (ironically cloaked in flag-waving nationalism) that says America is too weak, secular, and decadent to be a great nation.Some even seem to hold authoritarian or illiberal regimes—like those in Russia and Hungary—in high regard. Others believe it’s high time for a national divorce.To a lesser extent, these same themes are being mainstreamed by traditional conservatives. Consider, for example, Nikki Haley’s nostalgic yearning for better times that never really existed.The consequences are hard to quantify. If you’re a progressive who believes America is evil and racist, then its laws are illegitimate, and its values surely aren’t worth exporting anywhere else. (Never mind the fact that this creates a vacuum where the values that get exported come from glorious bastions of liberal tolerance like China and Russia.) “...the primary reason so many modern Amerians have proven to be so susceptible to the siren call of illiberalism stems from fundamental values of liberal democracy no longer being inculcated in young Americans via civics class in school.” Likewise, if you’re a rightwinger who believes that the left has taken over your nation, stolen elections, and indoctrinated (“groomed”) your children, then why wouldn’t you support an insurrection—or worse?To those on the left, I would say that America has made progress. We may not be perfect, and we sure have more improvements to make, but we are a more perfect union that we were in the past.To those on the right, America is still the greatest, freest country in the world. And the way to conserve traditional American values is by living your best life and supporting democratic processes and institutions—not via an illiberal power grab.  These sentiments are unlikely to sway anyone on either side. America faces a serious identity crisis, and there are many reasons we have arrived at this destination. Both the news media and social media deserve some of the blame for exacerbating existing divisions in our country.But I think the primary reason so many modern Americans have proven to be so susceptible to the siren call of illiberalism stems from fundamental values of liberal democracy no longer being inculcated in young Americans via civics class in school.As The Wall Street Journal reported back in May, just “13 percent of eighth-graders met proficiency standards for U.S. history, meaning they could explain major themes, periods, events, people, ideas and turning points in the country’s history.”To some degree, this tracks with an across-the-board decline in test scores that were a predictable result of COVID-19 school closures. Regardless, consider the stakes for our democracy. “These data are a national concern,” said Peggy Carr, National Center for Education Statistics commissioner. “The health of our democracy depends on informed and engaged citizens.”Principles like the rule of law, constitutionalism, pluralism, individual rights, etc., are not obvious or hereditary. They must be taught, but clearly they are not. The atrocious results predate the COVID shutdowns.According to one 2021 survey, “Two thirds of [college] students (66 percent) say it is acceptable to shout down a speaker to prevent them from speaking on campus, and almost one in four (23 percent) say it is acceptable to use violence to stop a campus speech.”Good luck trying to persuade the politicians and influencers on the left or the right to start acting responsibly (and give up the votes and the clicks). But when it comes to teaching civics to the next generation of Americans, the good news is (a) this is possible, and (b) some of the work has already begun.  I recently talked with Hanna Skandera, CEO and president of the Daniels Fund, a private charitable foundation that is working with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation to sponsor Civics Bees where 6th, 7th, and 8th grade students can compete to win cash prizes.Skandera, the former secretary of education for New Mexico under Republican Gov. Susana Martinez, sees civics education as perhaps the best way to begin turning things around.Restoring a belief in American exceptionalism and democratic values is not an easy or quick solution, but we have a shot if we can instill the values of liberal democracy in our American youths.We didn’t get into this mess overnight, and we won’t get out of it overnight, either. This will be a generational struggle that requires an all-hands-on-deck mentality.Otherwise, there may not be much to celebrate next Independence Day.  Matt LewisSenior Columnist@mattklewisGot a tip?
